# RoboticPrinting

This is a project using the Inkshield. Please see https://github.com/NicholasCLewis/InkShield if you desire to know more about it.

This project uses a robotic arm to realize samples of livery paints to aircrafts. To do that, it is used the cartridges to print pictures on a surface, the program uses openCV to collect the coordenates of the pixels of any image, and create a program to an ABB Robotic arm that has a tool with the Inkshield on its payload. The final result is: https://youtu.be/Kugj3Igr3w8.

The final report is also available in Portuguese.
